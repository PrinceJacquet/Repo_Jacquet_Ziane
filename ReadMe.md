# A nice work need a nice readme file

From <https://github.com/Cours-Master-SME/Minesweeper_template/blob/master/.gitignore>  
we had this exercise to challenge newly acquired git skills.

Still a long way to go before mastering git and/or cpp

This is a simple Minesweeper game made using cpp.

Necessary dependencies are cmake and make to build and run a Makefile

And ncurses library that did the heavy lifting regarding the interfaces.

Run on linux. (not tested elsewhere)
